# Pokedex

I created a pokedex with react. It's database is just a .json file. I did all read/write/edit operations by manipulating filesystem. 

## To use
```npm install  
```node server.js  

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!

## Changing the port

You can change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking any of the scripts above, e.g.,

```sh
PORT=3001 node server.js
```
